      OVERVIEW.
This IoT project aim to develop a smart water tap that automatically control water flow boud on hand proximity By utilizing a proximity server, the top will dispense water only when a band is detected, thereby conserving water and promoting hygiene

Components

* Microcontroller: Rasberry Pi

* Proximity senior-Detects presence of hand near the tap

* Relay module controls flow of electricity to the water ralre

* Water valve control water flow

* Water dispense water flows form the tap Benefits of this project to the community.

* Water conservation Signitione reduction in wate

* Improves Hygiene Minimizes physical contact us the top The database will be stening the following daty from the water sensor.

* Timestamp - time at which data was recorded
