      OVERVIEW.
This IoT project aim to develop a smart water tap that automatically control water flow boud on hand proximity By utilizing a proximity server, the top will dispense water only when a band is detected, thereby conserving water and promoting hygiene

Components

* Microcontroller: Rasberry Pi

* Proximity senior;Detects presence of hand near the tap

* Relay module; controls flow of electricity to the water valve

* Water valve; control water flow

* Water dispenser; water flows form the tap

* Benefits of this project to the community.

* Water conservation.Significance reduction in water westage

* Improves Hygiene. Minimizes physical contact us the tap.

* The database will be stening the following data from the water sensor;

* waterflow. In boolean form that is, on and off

* Timestamp - time at which data was recorded

    Steps:
